Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
- I like that he explained the cosmic address and each part of it
- Smooth transition to next part
- I like the cartoonish animation. It makes it seem less serious, but not so
much so that it seems unimportant
- He emphasized that the first organisms invented sex but didn't go into it xD
- He's from the Bronx!!! <3 <3 <3

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
- I like how he starts out describing how humans came into the world without
knowing much about what was going on
- I also like pattern recognition and I think it's very important to like
everything we've ever done
- Hooke is a bad boi
- Newton is always remembered as being the dude sitting under a tree when an
apple fell on his head but his story is so much deeper than that.
- I like that animation. Looks cool and (presumably) realistic
